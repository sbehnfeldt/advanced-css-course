Chapter 6: Building the Header - Part 1
* Basic reset: universal selector applies to every element
* font properties in the body selector, since they are inherited from parent
* background images use "url()" function, relative to location of the style sheet
* background gradients use also "background-image" property,
  * "linear-gradient()" function and others
* "background-size" property "sets the size of the element's background image" (MDN)
  * "cover" "scales the image as large as possible to fill the container, stretching
     the image if necessary" (MDN)
* "background-position" property "sets the initial position for each background image" (MDN)
  * "top" pins the top of the image; any necessary cropping crops elsewhere in the image
* "vh" is percentage of view port height
* "Percentages ... are defined relative to the value of the parent element's corresponding parameter"

* clip-path property and polygon() function

Chapter 7: Building the Header - Part 2
* Positioning an inline element is easiest if it is wrapped in a block element
* Position: absolute is relative to nearest positioned ancestor, so position an ancestor
  (usually with position: relative) even if that ancestor would otherwise be fine with static
  positioning.
* <h1> is the primary text for the page, for SEO and screen readers
* Use <span> to style text.  Multiple <span> within <h1> to style different parts of the <h1>.
  Style <span> with display: block to break it into two lines.  (<div>, which is a block element
  naturally, is not permitted within <h1>).
* Percentages in translate() function are defined relative to height and width of the element itself
  (not the parent element, as percentages usually are);


Chapter 8: Creating Cool CSS Animations
* Using the @keyframes @keyframes rule:
@keyframes [AnimationName] {
    [%] {
        [properties]
    }
}
* for browser performance, only animate opacity and transform
* "backface-visibility: none" on animated element suppresses animation jitter


Chapter 9: Building a Complex Animated Button - Part 1
* Psudo-elements and pseudo-classes; ::after pseudo-element; transition property
* Pseudo-classes are "special state" of selector, to style elements under special conditions
* :pseudo-class
* Padding on inline element does not move the element, so background will cover surrouding elements;
  to fix this, declare the ineline element with display: inline-block.
* Add transition property on *initial* state
